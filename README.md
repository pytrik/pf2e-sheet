# PF2e Character Sheet Builder

A single-page application for creating clean, readable Pathfinder 2nd Edition character sheets. The app compiles to a single HTML file for easy distribution and offline use.

## Overview

The app presents a two-panel interface: an input form on the left and a live A4 sheet preview on the right. Character sheets are divided into two pages — the first covering core stats and skills, the second covering abilities, attacks, and spells.

Key stats (AC, saves, skills, class DC, spell DC, attack bonuses, HP) are auto-calculated from ability modifiers and proficiency levels, with optional misc bonus fields for house rules and item bonuses. The app does not enforce game rules or include game data beyond the standard skill list, making it fully compatible with homebrew content.
